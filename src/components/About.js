                After dropping out of high school, I joined the Army. While
                serving active-duty, I obtained a bachelor's degree in business
                and then left the military to go to Boston College Law School.
                Working in Philadelphia's district attorney's office, I
                prosecuted felonies ranging from kidnappings and armed robberies
                to bar fights. I then worked for Boston College's Innocence
                Project representing a client who, at only eighteen, had been
                wrongfully incarcerated for three deaths, one of whom was his
                best friend. (While I've been at Code Fellows, the Project just
                filed his new trial motion!) Although I remain passionate about
                criminal justice, I realized I wanted a career that allowed me
                to be more creative while remaining intellectually engaging. So,
                I came to Code Fellows to become a software developer. Front-end
                design, especially making apps intuitive for casual users,
                attracts me the most to this career. I am experienced in HTML,
                CSS, and JavaScript, including React and Bootstrap.

                Hello, my name is Jovincent Del Mundo and I am a software
                developer based in California. Prior to web development I served
                in the United States Air Force as a signals Intelligence Analyst
                for four years. After the military I pursued my bachelor's
                degree in criminal justice, but 90% of the way through my degree
                I decided to take a computer science class. Needless to say, it
                piqued my interest enough to bring me to where I am today. Iâ€™ve
                always had a passion for art as a child and wanted to do
                something creative when I got older and as an adult, I also
                became more interested in technology and wanted to work in that
                industry. I feel as if my professional background in analysis in
                conjunction with my passion for creativity and technology would
                make software development the perfect outlet for all of those
                things.

              <p className="about-list-item">
                Software Developer with background in management, mechanical and
                electrical fields. US Air Force veteran with a wide range of
                experience in 8 years of career. Software development always
                amazed me, how it works and how I can change a website and make
                it more interactive. I really enjoy interactive and dynamic
                webpages, so I learned Javascript and React to enhance the look
                of the website. In my previous job in the electrical and
                mechanical field, I loved to troubleshoot various equipment and
                circuits and it gave me satisfaction to see the end results.
                Coding and troubleshooting issues to get the desired results
                gives me the same sense of gratification.
                <p>
                  Hobbies: I enjoys watching anime and movies. Love exploring
                  new hiking trails in Northern California. Believes in healthy
                  body healthy mind.
